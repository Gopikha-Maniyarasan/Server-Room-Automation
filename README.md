# Server-Room-Automation
This project focuses on automating the cooling system in a server room by monitoring temperature levels in real-time. When the temperature exceeds a set threshold, the system automatically turns on the fan and air conditioning units to prevent overheating and maintain optimal operating conditions for servers.
